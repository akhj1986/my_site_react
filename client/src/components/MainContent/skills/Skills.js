            I am experienced in HTML5 and CSS3, including the use of Flexbox. I
            currently style with SASS (SCSS), using Prepros as an auto-compiler.
            I also have experience in the use of Bootstrap 4, and always work
            using Git and NPM.

            I am loving the process of mastering modern JavaScript ES6 and am
            excited to continue building my JavaScript skills! I am familiar
            with the React framework and look forward to developing my skills in
            that direction as well.

            I have an extensive academic background, with a combined Bachelor’s
            degree in business and international studies and a Master’s degree
            in teaching. My exceptional academic performance, where I achieved a
            grade point average of 6.69 out of 7 across all studies, speaks
            volumes to my ability to learn, perform to deadlines, and submit
            high quality work.
